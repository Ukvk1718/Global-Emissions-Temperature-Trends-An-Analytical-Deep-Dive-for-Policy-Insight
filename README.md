# 🌍 Global Emissions & Temperature Trends  
### *An Analytical Deep Dive for Policy Insight*

---

## 📌 Overview

This project investigates the historical trends and relationships between global emissions, temperature anomalies, and environmental policies. Utilizing robust datasets, Python analytics, and Power BI dashboards, we offer actionable insights to inform environmental policy and ESG strategies.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

**How have global emissions and surface temperatures changed over time? What are the key drivers and anomalies, and how can this understanding guide data-driven environmental policies?**

---

## 📚 Background

With the increasing global shift toward ESG compliance and climate responsibility, understanding the historical interplay between emission levels, GDP, and temperature trends is crucial. This project aims to bridge the gap between raw climate data and policy decision-making by leveraging data science and business intelligence.

## 📊 Project Structure

### 🔍 Phase 1: Research & Data Collection

Collected from credible sources including OWID, NOAA, UNEP, and others:
- Annual CO₂, GHG, CH₄, and N₂O emissions by country
- Temperature anomaly datasets (global & hemispheric)
- Country-level GDP, population, HDI
- Historical global environmental policies (1750–2025)

---

### 🧼 Phase 2: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Analysis

Tool: `Python` (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Key Tasks:
- Data normalization, null-value handling, data type corrections
- Merged and enriched datasets
- EDA visualizations for:
  - Emissions by gas and country
  - Per capita emission disparity
  - Correlation between emissions and GDP
  - Temporal trends and anomalies

---

### 📈 Phase 3: Visualization & Reporting in Power BI

Tool: `Power BI Desktop`

#### Report Includes:
- 🌐 **Global Emissions Overview**
- 📈 **Emissions Trend & Correlation**
- 🌎 **Region & Country Breakdown**
